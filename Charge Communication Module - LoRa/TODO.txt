 #TODO 1: if time? Add switch for power saving between voltage divider on board
 Add switch (relay?) between battery on both arduino and being measured(maybe???) to reduce current consumption

In the above schematics, SW is a circuit that can connect or disconnect the sensing circuit 
depending on the voltage on ACT

the most common and cheap circuit is made of 
- NPN transistor Q1
- p-channel MOSFET Q2
- 1k-4.7k Ohm resistor R3
- 5k-20k Ohm resistor R4

#TODO 2: Add battery percentage estimator to sensor.cpp and sensor.h
      - based on power.cpp, power.h battery functions

#TODO 3: Classify possible sensors by very high, high and medium relevant
      - identify what characteristics need to be known
      - identify how these sensors inform us of this
      - identify the most efficient way to gain this need to know information

      RELEVANCE VS PRACTICALITY
      For each identified Parameter/Phenomenon, and their Relevance to Bees (etc)
      - cost effective
      - accurate
      - energy efficient
      - computationally simple
      - deployable
      - non-invasive
      - overall usability
